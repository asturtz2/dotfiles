A survey of literature may be appropriate but should be closely relatable the undergraduate experience supported by detailed analysis. Where appropriate, references to existing literature in the filed should be included. The thesis should be a minimum of 8 to 12 pages in length.\" \n\n\"Requirements for an Undergraduate Thesis for Degrees with Distinction The thesis must be the result of independent, sustained thought and intellectual curiosity. A survey of the literature about a particular topic is not sufficient however novel it may be. Ideally, there should be a clear formulation of a problem or question, scholarly study which illuminates or addresses it supported by the work done in Design Studio, and a conclusion supported by evidence. A bibliography and reference to existing literature in the field should be included where appropriate.
